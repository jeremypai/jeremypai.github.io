          + Devised an attention-based deep learning model to classify brain tumors on OCT images with 93.2% sensitivity and 99.8% 
            specificity on Gliomas, and 100% sensitivity and 96.0% specificity on Lymphomas
          + Refined the foundation model with a self-attention mechanism and achieved greater accuracy, improving the sensitivity 
            by approximately 1.3% and the specificity by approximately 1.3% on Gliomas, and the specificity by approximately 1.5% on Lymphomas
          + Visualized the deep learning model with Grad-CAM and t-SNE to explore what the model had learned
          + Published brain tumor research on OCT images with deep learning model

          A record of my experience in generating a 3D scene from scratch.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          3D Gaussian Splatting has attracted significant interest due to its capability for photorealistic scene reconstruction and fast rendering.
          The result is remarkably impressive, especially considering this is my initial attempt at creating such a photorealistic scene.
          The original images used for this project, which I gathered myself, are stored in this repository.
          I discovered that acquiring suitable input images is arguably the most demanding aspect of Gaussian Splatting, as the quality of these 
          source images can profoundly influence the fidelity of the reconstructed scene.
